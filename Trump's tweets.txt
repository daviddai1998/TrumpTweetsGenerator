1229	Feb 16, 2017 09:39:52 AM The Democrats had to come up with a story as to why they lost the election, and so badly (306), so they made up a story - RUSSIA. Fake news!
1230	
1231	Feb 16, 2017 09:10:49 AM FAKE NEWS media, which makes up stories and "sources," is far more effective than the discredited Democrats - but they are fading fast!

2286	
2287	Nov 15, 2016 08:40:29 AM The Electoral College is actually genius in that it brings all states, including the smaller ones, into play. Campaigning is much different!
2288	
2289	Nov 15, 2016 08:34:43 AM If the election were based on total popular vote I would have campaigned in N.Y. Florida and California and won even bigger and more easily
2290	
2291	Nov 13, 2016 01:46:36 PM The debates, especially the second and third, plus speeches and intensity of the large rallies, plus OUR GREAT SUPPORTERS, gave us the win!

2296	
2297	Nov 13, 2016 10:28:52 AM Governor John Kasich of the GREAT, GREAT, GREAT State of Ohio called to congratulate me on the win. The people of Ohio were incredible!

2303	Nov 13, 2016 09:43:09 AM The @nytimes sent a letter to their subscribers apologizing for their BAD coverage of me. I wonder if it will change - doubt it?

4272	
4273	Aug 26, 2016 11:01:03 AM I am very proud to have brought the subject of illegal immigration back into the discussion. Such a big problem for our country-I will solve

4293	Aug 25, 2016 09:40:04 PM Hillary Clinton only knows how to make a speech when it is a hit on me. No policy, and always very short (stamina). Media gives her a pass!
4294	
4295	Aug 25, 2016 04:25:15 PM HRC is using the oldest play in the Dem playbook- when their policies fail, they are left w/this one tired argument! https://t.co/FNbCMmwLTn 
4296	
4297	Aug 25, 2016 03:45:38 PM Hillary Clinton is using race-baiting to try to get African-American voters- but they know she is all talk and NO ACTION! 
4298	
4299	Aug 25, 2016 03:14:20 PM Hillary Clinton's short speech is pandering to the worst instincts in our society. She should be ashamed of herself! 
4300	
4301	Aug 25, 2016 03:11:41 PM Just watched recap of #CrookedHillary's speech. Very short and lies. She is the only one fear-mongering!

4455	Aug 14, 2016 08:34:25 PM Certain Republicans who have lost to me would rather save face by fighting me than see the U.S.Supreme Court get proper appointments. Sad!
4456	
4457	Aug 14, 2016 07:07:43 PM "Stay on message" is the chant. I always do - trade, jobs, military, vets, 2nd A, repeal Ocare, borders, etc - but media misrepresents!
4458	
4459	Aug 14, 2016 06:57:37 PM I have always been the same person-remain true to self.The media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so!
4460	
4461	Aug 14, 2016 12:06:20 PM It is not "freedom of the press" when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false!
4462	
4463	Aug 14, 2016 11:55:07 AM I am not only fighting Crooked Hillary, I am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process. People get it!
4464	
4465	Aug 14, 2016 11:50:51 AM Crooked Hillary Clinton is being protected by the media. She is not a talented person or politician. The dishonest media refuses to expose!
4466	
4467	Aug 14, 2016 07:46:17 AM My rallies are not covered properly by the media. They never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm.
4468	
4469	Aug 14, 2016 07:37:37 AM If the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didn't put false meaning into the words I say, I would be beating Hillary by 20%
4470	
4471	Aug 14, 2016 07:31:23 AM The failing @nytimes, which never spoke to me, keeps saying that I am saying to advisers that I will change. False, I am who I am-never said
4472	
4473	Aug 14, 2016 07:24:48 AM The failing @nytimes talks about anonymous sources and meetings that never happened. Their reporting is fiction. The media protects Hillary!

4715	Aug 5, 2016 08:08:35 AM Hillary Clinton has bad judgment and is unfit to serve as President. https://t.co/3EzG620fpT

4717	Aug 5, 2016 05:39:27 AM The plane I saw on television was the hostage plane in Geneva, Switzerland, not the plane carrying $400 million in cash going to Iran!

4720	
4721	Aug 4, 2016 09:19:08 PM Obama's disastrous judgment gave us ISIS, rise of Iran, and the worst economic numbers since the Great Depression! 
4722	
4723	Aug 4, 2016 09:18:18 PM President Obama should ask the DNC about how they rigged the election against Bernie.

4789	Aug 1, 2016 05:54:27 PM During the GOP convention, CNN cut away from the victims of illegal immigrant violence. They don‚Äôt want them heard. https://t.co/EHRiLkQDWD 
4790	
4791	Aug 1, 2016 05:52:39 PM When will CNN do a segment on Hillary‚Äôs plan to increase Syrian refugees 550% and how much it will cost? 
4792	
4793	Aug 1, 2016 05:52:00 PM Hillary Clinton raked in money from regimes that horribly oppress women and gays & refuses to speak out against Radical Islam. 
4794	
4795	Aug 1, 2016 05:46:28 PM Hillary, whose decisions have led to the deaths of many, accepted $ from a business linked to ISIS. Silence at CNN. https://t.co/gJYSSXtpaz

4803	Aug 1, 2016 01:47:54 PM People believe CNN these days almost as little as they believe Hillary....that's really saying something! 
4804	
4805	Aug 1, 2016 01:46:58 PM The people who support Hillary sit behind CNN anchor chairs, or headline fundraisers - those disconnected from real life. 
4806	
4807	Aug 1, 2016 01:45:22 PM Will CNN send its cameras to the border to show the massive unreported crisis now unfolding -- or are they worried it will hurt Hillary? 
4808	
4809	Aug 1, 2016 01:44:04 PM When will we see stories from CNN on Clinton Foundation corruption and Hillary's pay-for-play at State Department? 
4810	
4811	Aug 1, 2016 01:43:25 PM CNN anchors are completely out of touch with everyday people worried about rising crime, failing schools and vanishing jobs. 
4812	
4813	Aug 1, 2016 01:42:50 PM CNN will soon be the least trusted name in news if they continue to be the press shop for Hillary Clinton.

4818	
4819	Aug 1, 2016 08:03:02 AM So with all of the Obama tough talk on Russia and the Ukraine, they have already taken Crimea and continue to push. That's what I said!
4820	
4821	Aug 1, 2016 07:50:32 AM When I said in an interview that Putin is "not going into Ukraine, you can mark it down," I am saying if I am President. Already in Crimea!
4822	
4823	Aug 1, 2016 06:27:43 AM This story is not about Mr. Khan, who is all over the place doing interviews, but rather RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM and the U.S. Get smart!
4824	
4825	Aug 1, 2016 06:10:51 AM Mr. Khan, who does not know me, viciously attacked me from the stage of the DNC and is now all over T.V. doing the same - Nice!
4826	
4827	Jul 31, 2016 07:57:15 PM Wow, it is unbelievable how distorted, one-sided and biased the media is against us. The failing @nytimes is a joke. @CNN is laughable!

4830	
4831	Jul 31, 2016 03:09:00 PM The dishonest media is fawning over the Democratic Convention. I wonder why, then, my speech had millions of more viewers than Crooked H?
4832	
4833	Jul 31, 2016 08:32:55 AM I was viciously attacked by Mr. Khan at the Democratic Convention. Am I not allowed to respond? Hillary voted for the Iraq war, not me!
4834	
4835	Jul 31, 2016 07:57:21 AM Captain Khan, killed 12 years ago, was a hero, but this is about RADICAL ISLAMIC TERROR and the weakness of our "leaders" to eradicate it!
4836

4848	
4849	Jul 30, 2016 05:12:36 PM The "Rust Belt" was created by politicians like the Clintons who allowed our jobs to be stolen from us by other countries like Mexico. END!
4850	
4851	Jul 30, 2016 05:04:14 PM Crooked's stop in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, where jobs have been absolutely decimated by dumb politicians, drew less than 200 - with Bill, VP
4852	
4853	Jul 30, 2016 04:55:48 PM #CrookedHillary = Obama's third term, which would be terrible news for our economic growth - seen below. https://t.co/y9WJoUaaql 
4854	
4855	Jul 30, 2016 04:51:25 PM Word is that Crooked Hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in Pennsylvania. Perhaps it is because her husband signed NAFTA?
4856	
4857	Jul 30, 2016 03:01:32 PM I turned down a meeting with Charles and David Koch. Much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics, they will do much better!
4858	
4859	Jul 30, 2016 02:55:26 PM Why doesn't the media want to report that on the two "Big Thursdays" when Crooked Hillary and I made our speeches - Republican's won ratings

4862	
4863	Jul 30, 2016 01:07:07 PM Crooked Hillary Clinton is soft on crime, supports open borders, and wants massive tax hikes. A formula for disaster! 
4864	
4865	Jul 30, 2016 01:06:17 PM Violent crime is rising across the United States, yet the DNC convention ignored it. Crime reduction will be one of my top priorities.

4877	Jul 30, 2016 07:57:48 AM We are suffering through the worst long-term unemployment in the last 70 years. I want change - Crooked Hillary Clinton does not. 
4878	
4879	Jul 30, 2016 07:54:44 AM Hillary can never win over Bernie supporters. Her foreign wars, NAFTA/TPP support & Wall Street ties are driving away millions of votes. 
4880

4906	
4907	Jul 29, 2016 12:03:56 PM Wow, my campaign is hearing from more and more Bernie supporters that they will NEVER support Crooked Hillary. She sold them out, V.P. pick!

4910	
4911	Jul 29, 2016 11:56:30 AM The dishonest media didn't mention that Bernie Sanders was very angry looking during Crooked's speech. He wishes he didn't make that deal!

4915	Jul 29, 2016 09:14:25 AM Crooked Hillary said that I "couldn't handle the rough and tumble of a political campaign." Really,I just beat 16 people and am beating her!
4916	
4917	Jul 29, 2016 09:06:38 AM If Michael Bloomberg ran again for Mayor of New York, he wouldn't get 10% of the vote - they would run him out of town! #NeverHillary
4918	
4919	Jul 29, 2016 08:59:42 AM "Little" Michael Bloomberg, who never had the guts to run for president, knows nothing about me. His last term as Mayor was a disaster!
4920	
4921	Jul 29, 2016 08:53:31 AM General John Allen, who I never met but spoke against me last night, failed badly in his fight against ISIS. His record = BAD #NeverHillary
4922	
4923	Jul 29, 2016 08:44:54 AM Crooked Hillary Clinton mentioned me 22 times in her very long and very boring speech. Many of her statements were lies and fabrications!

4932	
4933	Jul 29, 2016 07:51:13 AM Crooked Hillary Clinton made up facts about me, and "forgot" to mention the many problems of our country, in her very average scream!
4934	
4935	Jul 29, 2016 07:40:10 AM The media coverage this morning of the very average Clinton speech and Convention is a joke. @CNN and the little watched @Morning_Joe = SAD!
4936	
4937	Jul 28, 2016 10:59:04 PM No one has worse judgement than Hillary Clinton - corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes. 
4938	
4939	Jul 28, 2016 10:57:06 PM Hillary's wars in the Middle East have unleashed destruction, terrorism and ISIS across the world. 
4940	
4941	Jul 28, 2016 10:54:22 PM Hillary's vision is a borderless world where working people have no power, no jobs, no safety. 
4942	
4943	Jul 28, 2016 10:52:46 PM Hillary will never reform Wall Street. She is owned by Wall Street! 
4944	
4945	Jul 28, 2016 10:50:59 PM Our way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words. 
4946	
4947	Jul 28, 2016 10:47:56 PM Hillary's refusal to mention Radical Islam, as she pushes a 550% increase in refugees, is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country.

5006	
5007	Jul 27, 2016 08:01:03 AM Not one American flag on the massive stage at the Democratic National Convention until people started complaining-then a small one. Pathetic
5008	
5009	Jul 27, 2016 07:57:20 AM Our not very bright Vice President, Joe Biden, just stated that I wanted to "carpet bomb" the enemy. Sorry Joe, that was Ted Cruz!
5010	
5011	Jul 27, 2016 05:08:35 AM Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to flood our country with Syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about. The danger is massive. NO!
5012	
5013	Jul 27, 2016 05:01:39 AM Hopefully the violent and vicious killing by ISIS of a beloved French priest is causing people to start thinking rationally. Get tough!
5014	
5015	Jul 27, 2016 04:50:55 AM The Democratic Convention has paid ZERO respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country. No recognition - SAD!
5016	
5017	Jul 27, 2016 04:43:16 AM Funny how the failing @nytimes is pushing Dems narrative that Russia is working for me because Putin said "Trump is a genius." America 1st!
5018	
5019	Jul 27, 2016 04:33:52 AM As I have been saying, Crooked Hillary will approve the job killing TPP after the election, despite her statements to the contrary: top adv.
5020	
5021	Jul 26, 2016 10:01:04 PM Just like I have warned from the beginning, Crooked Hillary Clinton will betray you on the TPP. https://t.co/eoNTWK6I8y 
5022	
5023	Jul 26, 2016 09:11:47 PM Many of Bernie's supporters have left the arena. Did Bernie go home and go to sleep?
5024	
5025	Jul 26, 2016 09:08:50 PM I hate to say it, but the Republican Convention was far more interesting (with a much more beautiful set) than the Democratic Convention!
5026	
5027	Jul 26, 2016 09:02:24 PM No matter what Bill Clinton says and no matter how well he says it, the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible. Highly overrated!

5039	Jul 26, 2016 05:47:28 PM In order to try and deflect the horror and stupidity of the Wikileakes disaster, the Dems said maybe it is Russia dealing with Trump. Crazy!
5040	
5041	Jul 26, 2016 02:48:08 PM Dems don't want to talk ISIS b/c Hillary's foreign interventions unleashed ISIS & her refugee plans make it easier for them to come here. 
5042	
5043	Jul 26, 2016 02:27:58 PM Bernie's exhausted, he just wants to shut down and go home to bed! 
5044	
5045	Jul 26, 2016 02:27:43 PM The invention of email has proven to be a very bad thing for Crooked Hillary in that it has proven her to be both incompetent and a liar!

5054	
5055	Jul 26, 2016 07:38:27 AM Why aren't the Democrats speaking about ISIS, bad trade deals, broken borders, police and law and order. The Republican Convention was great
5056	
5057	Jul 26, 2016 07:34:19 AM Funny, if you listen to @FoxNews, the Democrats did not have a good day. If you listen to the other two, they are fawning. What a difference
5058	
5059	Jul 25, 2016 10:19:38 PM Bernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. All of that work, energy and money, and nothing to show for it! Waste of time.
5060	
5061	Jul 25, 2016 10:12:57 PM Elizabeth Warren, often referred to as Pocahontas, just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary, who she always hated!
5062	
5063	Jul 25, 2016 10:04:56 PM Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution. We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs. 
5064	
5065	Jul 25, 2016 09:14:29 PM If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party, they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself. 
5066	
5067	Jul 25, 2016 04:57:14 PM I was at @FoxNews and met Juan Williams in passing. He asked if he could have pictures taken with me. I said fine. He then trashes on air!
5068	
5069	Jul 25, 2016 04:45:54 PM Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold. He got NOTHING for all of the time, energy and money. The V.P. a joke!
5070	
5071	Jul 25, 2016 04:33:49 PM While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers. 
5072	
5073	Jul 25, 2016 04:32:59 PM Clinton betrayed Bernie voters. Kaine supports TPP, is in pocket of Wall Street, and backed Iraq War.

5084	
5085	Jul 25, 2016 09:01:25 AM The State of Florida is so embarrassed by the antics of Crooked Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz that they will vote for CHANGE!
5086	
5087	Jul 25, 2016 08:47:45 AM Wow, the Republican Convention went so smoothly compared to the Dems total mess. But fear not, the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn!
5088	
5089	Jul 25, 2016 08:42:55 AM Here we go again with another Clinton scandal, and e-mails yet (can you believe). Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in, B never had a chance!
5090	
5091	Jul 25, 2016 08:19:18 AM Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her "servant" was doing at the DNC - they just got caught, that's all! They laughed at Bernie.
5092	
5093	Jul 25, 2016 07:27:35 AM If Bernie Sanders, after seeing the just released e-mails, continues to look exhausted and done, then his legacy will never be the same.
5094	
5095	Jul 25, 2016 07:26:56 AM Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain https://t.co/Pzs9uwgzam [Twitter for iPad] 
5096	
5097	Jul 25, 2016 07:02:01 AM Hillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened!
5098	
5099	Jul 25, 2016 06:57:17 AM How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails, using even religion, against Bernie!
5100	
5101	Jul 25, 2016 06:31:22 AM The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes me
5102	
5103	Jul 24, 2016 06:59:10 PM Watched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes. No way they are going to fix America's problems. ISIS & all others laughing!
5104	
5105	Jul 24, 2016 06:47:08 PM The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good, but for the final night, my speech, great. Thank you!
5106	
5107	Jul 24, 2016 05:33:42 PM The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory, she's out!
5108	
5109	Jul 24, 2016 05:16:59 PM The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive & well!
5110	
5111	Jul 24, 2016 05:07:49 PM Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength, I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook!
5112	
5113	Jul 24, 2016 05:02:42 PM Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top, DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed out
5114	
5115	Jul 24, 2016 04:53:29 PM If the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails, resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie), media would go wild
5116	
5117	Jul 24, 2016 03:45:31 PM The @CNN panels are so one sided, almost all against Trump. @FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Don't watch CNN!
5118	
5119	Jul 24, 2016 03:30:06 PM I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted, no energy left!
5120	
5121	Jul 24, 2016 03:20:57 PM Today proves what I have always known, that @Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one, not Debbie Wasserman Shultz (@DWStweets.) 
5122	
5123	Jul 24, 2016 08:30:59 AM Sorry folks, but Bernie Sanders is exhausted, just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD!
5124	
5125	Jul 24, 2016 08:27:56 AM There is no longer a Bernie Sanders "political revolution." He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end!
5126	
5127	Jul 24, 2016 07:30:15 AM An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates.
5128	
5129	Jul 24, 2016 07:15:51 AM Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not, their BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite!
5130	
5131	Jul 24, 2016 06:56:43 AM Wow, President Obama's brother, Malik, just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else!
5132	
5133	Jul 24, 2016 06:25:06 AM Bernie Sanders started off strong, but with the selection of Kaine for V.P., is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPECT
5134	
5135	Jul 24, 2016 06:16:15 AM The Crooked Hillary V.P. choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H!

5144	
5145	Jul 23, 2016 04:20:58 PM The Wikileaks e-mail release today was so bad to Sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her, unless he is a fraud! 
5146	
5147	Jul 23, 2016 03:43:33 PM Just saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together. ISIS and our other enemies are drooling. They don't look presidential to me!
5148	
5149	Jul 23, 2016 11:06:15 AM I will bring jobs back and get wages up. People haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. Clinton killed jobs!
5150	
5151	Jul 23, 2016 10:36:41 AM Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. Job killer!
5152	
5153	Jul 23, 2016 10:01:48 AM Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. I will bring jobs back!
5154	
5155	Jul 23, 2016 09:51:32 AM Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania. Against steelworkers and miners. Husband signed NAFTA.
5156	
5157	Jul 23, 2016 05:55:20 AM Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes, really vicious. RIGGED
5158	
5159	Jul 23, 2016 05:42:10 AM Pocahontas wanted V.P. slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate. Also, Crooked Hillary hates her!
5160	
5161	Jul 23, 2016 05:35:37 AM Tim Kaine is, and always has been, owned by the banks. Bernie supporters are outraged, was their last choice. Bernie fought for nothing!
5162	
5163	Jul 23, 2016 05:31:18 AM The Bernie Sanders supporters are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine, who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for. Philly fight?

5169	Jul 22, 2016 10:23:15 PM Is it the same Kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while Governor of Virginia and didn't get indicted while Bob M did?

5242	
5243	Jul 20, 2016 10:36:06 AM The media is spending more time doing a forensic analysis of Melania's speech than the FBI spent on Hillary's emails. [Twitter Web Client] 
5244	
5245	Jul 20, 2016 10:31:15 AM Good news is Melania's speech got more publicity than any in the history of politics especially if you believe that all press is good press! [Twitter Web Client]

5247	Jul 20, 2016 07:51:58 AM In November, I think the people of Ohio will remember that the Republicans picked Cleveland instead of going to another state. Jobs!

5290	
5291	Jul 17, 2016 08:09:02 AM The ratings at @FoxNews blow away the ratings of @CNN - not even close. That's because CNN is the Clinton News Network and people don't like
5292	
5293	Jul 17, 2016 08:04:10 AM .@FoxNews is much better, and far more truthful, than @CNN, which is all negative. Guests are stacked for Crooked Hillary! I don't watch.

5296	
5297	Jul 17, 2016 07:14:46 AM I hope that Crooked Hillary picks Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, as her V.P. Then we can litigate her fraud!
5298	
5299	Jul 17, 2016 07:06:18 AM It doesn't matter that Crooked Hillary has experience, look at all of the bad decisions she has made. Bernie said she has bad judgement!
5300	
5301	Jul 17, 2016 06:55:21 AM As the days and weeks go by, we see what a total mess our country (and world) is in - Crooked Hillary Clinton led Obama into bad decisions!

5305	Jul 16, 2016 11:15:49 PM Goofy Elizabeth Warren, who may be the least productive Senator in the U.S. Senate, must prove she is not a fraud. Without the con it's over

5319	Jul 16, 2016 08:23:17 AM Crooked Hillary Clinton is bought and paid for by Wall Street, lobbyists and special interests. She will sell our country down the tubes!
5320	
5321	Jul 16, 2016 08:19:11 AM Very sad that a person who has made so many mistakes, Crooked Hillary Clinton, can put out such false and vicious ads with her phony money!
5322	
5323	Jul 16, 2016 08:13:56 AM Crooked Hillary, who embarrassed herself and the country with her e-mail lies, has been a DISASTER on foreign policy. Look what's happening!
5324	
5325	Jul 16, 2016 08:08:43 AM Crooked Hillary is spending big Wall Street money on ads saying I don't have foreign policy experience, yet look what her policies have done

5352	
5353	Jul 13, 2016 05:27:45 PM Even the @NYTimes and @WashingtonPost Editorial Boards condemned Justice Ginsburg for her ethical and legal breach. What was she thinking? 
5354	
5355	Jul 13, 2016 05:26:20 PM Is Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg going to apologize to me for her misconduct? Big mistake by an incompetent judge!

5390	
5391	Jul 12, 2016 12:01:51 PM Bernie Sanders endorsing Crooked Hillary Clinton is like Occupy Wall Street endorsing Goldman Sachs.

5396	
5397	Jul 12, 2016 08:36:47 AM Bernie Sanders, who has lost most of his leverage, has totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. He will endorse her today - fans angry!
5398

5417	Jul 10, 2016 01:58:10 PM I heard that the underachieving John King of @CNN on Inside Politics was one hour of lies. Happily, few people are watching - dead network!
5418	
5419	Jul 10, 2016 01:42:32 PM The media is so dishonest. If I make a statement, they twist it and turn it to make it sound bad or foolish.They think the public is stupid!
5420	
5421	Jul 10, 2016 01:27:58 PM President Obama thinks the nation is not as divided as people think. He is living in a world of the make believe!

5455	Jul 6, 2016 10:32:35 AM Convention speaker schedule to be released tomorrow. Let today be devoted to Crooked Hillary and the rigged system under which we live. [Twitter Web Client] 
5456	
5457	Jul 6, 2016 09:06:38 AM I have over seven million hits on social media re Crooked Hillary Clinton. Check it out Sleepy Eyes, @MarkHalperin @NBCPolitics
5458	
5459	Jul 6, 2016 09:01:09 AM Sleepy eyes Chuck Todd, a man with so little touch for politics, is at it again.He could not have watched my standing ovation speech in N.C.
5460	
5461	Jul 6, 2016 08:24:50 AM Even the once great Caesars is bankrupt in A.C. Others to follow. Ask the Democrat City Council what happened to Atlantic City.
5462	
5463	Jul 6, 2016 08:12:43 AM Hillary Clinton should ask why the Democrat pols in Atlantic City made all the wrong moves - Convention Center, Airport - and destroyed City
5464	
5465	Jul 6, 2016 08:08:44 AM I made a lot of money in Atlantic City and left 7 years ago, great timing (as all know). Pols made big mistakes, now many bankruptcies.
5466	
5467	Jul 6, 2016 07:31:27 AM Crooked Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI and to the people of our country. She is sooooo guilty. But watch, her time will come!
5468	
5469	Jul 6, 2016 07:11:03 AM The rigged system may have helped Hillary Clinton escape criminal charges, but...https://t.co/KO64IAMDgj https://t.co/8CBSfNpl2l 
5470	
5471	Jul 6, 2016 06:21:34 AM Crooked Hillary has once again been proven to be a person who is dishonest, incompetent and of very bad judgement.
5472	
5473	Jul 6, 2016 06:12:45 AM Crooked Hillary Clinton and her team "were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information." Not fit!
5474	
5475	Jul 5, 2016 11:36:31 PM Crooked Hillary Clinton is unfit to serve as President of the U.S. Her temperament is weak and her opponents are strong. BAD JUDGEMENT!
5476	
5477	Jul 5, 2016 11:30:04 PM I don't think the voters will forget the rigged system that allowed Crooked Hillary to get away with "murder." Come November 8, she's out!
5478	
5479	Jul 5, 2016 11:23:03 PM Raised a lot of money for the Republican Party. There will be a big gasp when the figures are announced in the morning. Lots of support! Win

5492	
5493	Jul 5, 2016 06:14:58 AM Taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of Air Force One on the campaign trail by President Obama and Crooked Hillary. A total disgrace!
5494	
5495	Jul 4, 2016 05:59:46 PM On @FoxNews at 7:00 P.M. "Special: Meet the Trumps" Hope you enjoy!
5496	
5497	Jul 4, 2016 05:30:15 PM Why is President Obama allowed to use Air Force One on the campaign trail with Crooked Hillary? She is flying with him tomorrow. Who pays?
5498	
5499	Jul 4, 2016 10:34:15 AM With Hillary and Obama, the terrorist attacks will only get worse. Politically correct fools, won't even call it what it is - RADICAL ISLAM!
5500	
5501	Jul 4, 2016 10:26:56 AM Crooked Hillary Clinton is "guilty as hell" but the system is totally rigged and corrupt! Where are the 33,000 missing e-mails?
5502	
5503	Jul 4, 2016 09:25:04 AM The only people who are not interested in being the V.P. pick are the people who have not been asked!
5504	
5505	Jul 4, 2016 09:19:13 AM I look forward to meeting @joniernst today in New Jersey. She has done a great job as Senator of Iowa!
5506	
5507	Jul 4, 2016 09:11:09 AM Spent time with Indiana Governor Mike Pence and family yesterday. Very impressed, great people!
5508	
5509	Jul 4, 2016 08:56:34 AM Senator Tom Cotton was great on Meet the Press yesterday. Despite a totally one-sided interview by Chuck Todd, the end result was solid!
5510	
5511	Jul 4, 2016 08:42:16 AM Dishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the Star of David rather than a Sheriff's Star, or plain star!
5512	
5513	Jul 4, 2016 08:32:35 AM Happy 4th of July! #Trump2016 #AmericaFirst https://t.co/Ndb3AQrLtY https://t.co/YhHyQjwJW6 
5514	
5515	Jul 4, 2016 07:00:11 AM Crooked Hillary will NEVER be able to handle the complexities and danger of ISIS - it will just go on forever. We need change!
5516	
5517	Jul 4, 2016 06:54:40 AM The third mass attack (slaughter) in days by ISIS. 200 dead in Baghdad, worst in many years. We do not have leadership that can stop this!
5518	
5519	Jul 4, 2016 06:35:16 AM In Bangladesh, hostages were immediately killed by ISIS terrorists if they were unable to cite a verse from the Koran. 20 were killed!
5520	
5521	Jul 3, 2016 04:46:58 PM I believe that Crooked Hillary sent Bill to have the meeting with the U.S.A.G. So Bill is not in trouble with H except that he got caught!
5522	
5523	Jul 3, 2016 04:43:25 PM The SECRET meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. in back of closed plane was heightened with FBI shouting "go away, no pictures."
5524	
5525	Jul 3, 2016 04:38:20 PM Does anybody really believe that Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. talked only about "grandkids" and golf for 37 minutes in plane on tarmac?
5526	
5527	Jul 3, 2016 04:00:39 PM "THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED!"
5528	
5529	Jul 3, 2016 03:47:51 PM On Saturday a great man, Elie Wiesel, passed away.The world is a better place because of him and his belief that good can triumph over evil!
5530	
5531	Jul 3, 2016 03:20:20 PM Crooked Hillary Clinton knew that her husband wanted to meet with the U.S.A.G. to work out a deal. The system is totally rigged & corrupt!
5532	
5533	Jul 3, 2016 03:16:23 PM Only a fool would believe that the meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. was not arranged or that Crooked Hillary did not know.
5534	
5535	Jul 3, 2016 12:40:49 PM Just watched @meetthepress and how totally biased against me Chuck Todd, and the entire show, is against me.The good news-the people get it!
5536	
5537	Jul 2, 2016 04:13:02 PM It was just announced-by sources-that no charges will be brought against Crooked Hillary Clinton. Like I said, the system is totally rigged!
5538	
5539	Jul 2, 2016 03:39:39 PM It is impossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. What she did was wrong! What Bill did was stupid!

5558	
5559	Jul 2, 2016 06:48:18 AM Just read in the failing @nytimes that I was not aware "the event had to be held in Cleveland" - a total lie. These people are sick!

5576	
5577	Jul 1, 2016 07:12:48 AM Take a look at what happened w/ Bill Clinton. The system is totally rigged. Does anybody really believe that meeting was just a coincidence? 
5578	
5579	Jul 1, 2016 07:12:06 AM Bill Clinton's meeting was a total secret. Nobody was to know about it but he was caught by a local reporter. 
5580	
5581	Jul 1, 2016 07:11:41 AM As Bernie Sanders said, Hillary Clinton has bad judgement. Bill's meeting was probably initiated and demanded by Hillary!

5587	Jun 30, 2016 02:30:54 PM The reason I put up approximately $50 million for my successful primary campaign is very simple, I want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 
5588	
5589	Jun 30, 2016 02:30:20 PM I have self funded my winning primary campaign with an approx. $50 million loan. I have totally terminated the loan! 
5590	
5591	Jun 30, 2016 02:29:48 PM The very dishonest @NBCNews refuses to accept the fact that I have forgiven my $50 million loan to my campaign. Done deal! 
5592	
5593	Jun 30, 2016 02:28:27 PM One of the reasons Hillary hid her emails was so the public wouldn't see how she got rich- selling out America. https://t.co/mO9QrmYXRD

5619	Jun 29, 2016 08:14:56 AM Why would the USChamber be upset by the fact that I want to negotiate better and stronger trade deals or that I want penalties for cheaters?
5620	
5621	Jun 29, 2016 08:09:49 AM The @USCHAMBER must fight harder for the American worker. China, and many others, are taking advantage of U.S. with our terrible trade pacts

5678	
5679	Jun 26, 2016 06:36:14 AM Clinton is trying to wash away her bad judgement call on BREXIT with big dollar ads. Disgraceful!
